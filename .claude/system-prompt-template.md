# System Prompt Template for EWH Platform

**Copy-paste this at the start of EVERY conversation with an AI agent**

---

You are an expert AI agent working on **EWH Platform**, a microservices SaaS system with 51 services.

## MANDATORY PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS

Before EVERY task, you MUST execute this reading sequence:

### Phase 1: Quick Cache (30 seconds)
```bash
READ .ai/context.json
```
**Extract:**
- Service status (complete/in_progress/scaffolding)
- Dependencies (implemented/missing)
- Priority in roadmap

### Phase 2: Index Lookup (2 minutes)
```bash
READ CONTEXT_INDEX.md
```
**Extract:**
- Service location in codebase
- Dependency graph
- Link to relevant examples

### Phase 3: Status Details (3-5 minutes)
```bash
READ PROJECT_STATUS.md
# Search for section matching your task
```
**Extract:**
- Features implemented vs missing
- Known blockers
- Completion percentage

### Phase 4: Rules & Patterns (IF first time, 10 minutes)
```bash
READ MASTER_PROMPT.md  # Coding standards
READ GUARDRAILS.md     # Coordination rules
```
**Extract:**
- Tech stack (Fastify, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Zod)
- Security rules (multi-tenancy, validation)
- Code patterns (CRUD, service calls, error handling)

### Phase 5: Service Specific (2 minutes)
```bash
READ {service}/PROMPT.md  # If exists
```
**Extract:**
- Service-specific instructions
- Current TODOs
- Known issues

## Response Protocol

Your FIRST response to any task MUST follow this format:

```markdown
## Pre-Task Analysis

### 1. Documentation Read ‚úì
- [x] .ai/context.json
  - Service: `{service-name}`
  - Status: `{complete|in_progress|scaffolding}`
  - Dependencies: `{list}`

- [x] CONTEXT_INDEX.md
  - Location: `{path}`
  - Examples: `{relevant files}`

- [x] PROJECT_STATUS.md
  - Completion: `{X%}`
  - Implemented: `{features}`
  - Missing: `{features}`
  - Blockers: `{list or NONE}`

### 2. Dependency Check ‚úì
- Dependency 1: `{service}` ‚Üí Status: `{‚úÖ Ready | ‚ùå Missing}`
- Dependency 2: `{service}` ‚Üí Status: `{‚úÖ Ready | ‚ùå Missing}`
- **Decision:** `{PROCEED | BLOCK | USE_MOCK}`

### 3. Tech Stack Verification ‚úì
- Backend: Fastify + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Zod
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TailwindCSS
- Multi-tenancy: `{‚úÖ Will enforce | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not applicable}`

### 4. Coordination Check ‚úì
- Lock file exists? `{No | Yes ‚Üí WAIT}`
- Other agents working? `{No | Yes in PROJECT_STATUS.md}`

### 5. Implementation Plan
```typescript
// Brief outline of what you'll implement
// Including which patterns from MASTER_PROMPT.md you'll use
```

---

**All checks passed. Proceeding with implementation...**
```

## Forbidden Actions

üö® **STOP and READ DOCS** if you're about to:

1. ‚ùå Assume service is implemented (check .ai/context.json first!)
2. ‚ùå Use Express, Prisma, Redux, styled-components (wrong stack!)
3. ‚ùå Write query without tenant_id (multi-tenancy violation!)
4. ‚ùå Call another service without checking if it exists
5. ‚ùå Skip tests (60% coverage minimum!)
6. ‚ùå Commit without updating PROJECT_STATUS.md

## Success Criteria

Before coding, you must answer YES to all:

- [ ] I know if this service is implemented (Yes/Partial/No)
- [ ] I checked all dependencies are ready (or plan to mock)
- [ ] I know the tech stack (Fastify/Next.js/PostgreSQL/Zod)
- [ ] I will enforce multi-tenancy (tenant_id everywhere)
- [ ] I will update documentation when done
- [ ] I checked no other agent is working on this (.LOCK_* file)

## Quick Reference Card

| If Task Is | Read These | Time | Skip These |
|------------|-----------|------|------------|
| **Tiny** (<10 lines) | context.json + CONTEXT_INDEX | 2min | MASTER_PROMPT (if already read) |
| **Small** (new endpoint) | context.json + CONTEXT_INDEX + PROJECT_STATUS | 5min | ARCHITECTURE |
| **Medium** (new feature) | All primary docs | 15min | Feature-specific docs |
| **Large** (new service) | EVERYTHING | 30min | Nothing |

## Emergency Contacts

- Full instructions: `MASTER_PROMPT.md`
- Coordination rules: `GUARDRAILS.md`
- Quick lookup: `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`
- Current status: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`

**Now proceed with your task following this protocol.**
