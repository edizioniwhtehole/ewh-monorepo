# Real Estate SaaS - Final Pricing Strategy (Per-User Match + Feature Laddering)

## Executive Summary

**Strategy**: Match competitor per-user pricing (€9-39/user/month) but with **superior features** that force customers to upgrade to higher tiers where we have better margins and unique capabilities.

**Key Insight**: Give away basic features (commoditized), monetize premium features (AI, automation, analytics) that have near-zero marginal cost but high perceived value.

## 2. Our Pricing Strategy: Feature Parity + Superior Upgrades

### Philosophy

**Tiers 1-3**: Match/beat their features at same/lower price
**Tiers 4-5**: Offer features they don't have (AI enhancement, virtual staging, advanced analytics)

### Pricing Per User (Match Market)

| Tier | €/user/month | Annual (15% discount) | Target | Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------------------|--------|----------|
| **Free** | €0 | €0 | Solo agents, trial | Hook - better than Realgest Free |
| **Starter** | **€9.90** | €101 | Small agencies (1-3 users) | **Parity with Gestim Personal** |
| **Professional** | **€19.90** | €203 | Medium agencies (3-10 users) | **Better than Gestim Pro** |
| **Business** | **€29.90** | €305 | Large agencies (10-25 users) | **Better than Gestim Gold** |
| **Enterprise** | **€49.90** | €509 | XL agencies (25+ users) | **Features Gestim doesn't have** |

### Why This Works

**For customers**:
- ✅ "Same price as Gestim, but better features"
- ✅ Easy comparison (apples to apples)
- ✅ Clear upgrade path

**For us**:
- ✅ Competitive on price (can't say we're expensive)
- ✅ Better features force upgrades to €29-49 tiers
- ✅ €29-49 tiers have 85-90% margins
- ✅ AI/automation features have near-zero marginal cost

## 4. Strategic Feature Placement (Force Upgrades)

### Key Features Placed Strategically

#### AI Photo Enhancement (Business €29.90+)

**Why here**:
- Zero marginal cost for us (OpenAI API ~€0.02/image)
- High perceived value (photos look 10x better)
- Competitors don't have this (Gestim Gold has basic editor, not AI)
- **Forces photographers/luxury agents to Business tier**

**Limits**:
- Professional: 20/month (teaser, not enough)
- Business: 200/month (enough for 20 properties × 10 photos)
- Enterprise: Unlimited

**Psychology**: "I tried 20 enhancements, they're amazing, but I need 100/month → upgrade to Business"

#### Virtual Staging (Business €29.90+, Full at Enterprise €49.90)

**Why here**:
- Near-zero marginal cost (~€0.50/image, but high perceived value €20-50/image)
- **Nobody else has this** (unique differentiator)
- Luxury/empty property agents MUST have this
- **Forces premium segment to Enterprise tier**

**Limits**:
- Professional: ❌ None (taste of AI enhancement, but not staging)
- Business: 10/month (enough for 2-3 properties)
- Enterprise: 100/month (enough for 10-15 properties)

**Psychology**: "Virtual staging makes empty properties sell 3x faster, I need this → upgrade to Business/Enterprise"

#### Advanced Automation (Business €29.90+)

**Why here**:
- Zero marginal cost (just software logic)
- High perceived value (saves hours per week)
- Competitors have this only at Platinum (€32/user)
- **Forces busy agents to Business tier**

**Features**:
- AI-powered follow-up timing (when to call/email based on engagement)
- Auto-assignment (new leads → best agent based on performance)
- Predictive deal scoring (which deals likely to close)

**Psychology**: "Manual follow-ups waste 10 hours/week, automation saves time → upgrade to Business"

#### API Access (Business €29.90+)

**Why here**:
- Zero marginal cost
- High value for tech-savvy agencies (integrate with custom tools)
- Competitors only at Pro/Platinum tiers
- **Forces growing agencies to Business tier**

#### WhatsApp Business Integration (Business €29.90+)

**Why here**:
- Italian market loves WhatsApp (80% prefer it over email)
- Zero marginal cost (WhatsApp Business API is free for small volume)
- Competitors don't have this well-integrated
- **Forces modern agencies to Business tier**

#### White Label (Enterprise €49.90 only)

**Why here**:

- **Forces franchises/networks to Enterprise tier**

## 5. Pricing Psychology & Upgrade Triggers

### Free Tier (€0)

**Purpose**: Lead magnet, trial, solo agents

**Limits designed to frustrate**:
- 25 properties (OK for solo agent, but not enough for small agency)
- 10 photos/property (not enough for luxury properties)
- 100 contacts (fills up fast)
- No automation (manual work is painful)

**Upgrade trigger**: "I have 30 properties now, need to upgrade to Starter"

### Starter (€9.90/user/month)

**Purpose**: Match Gestim Personal, win small agencies

**Limits designed to frustrate**:
- 100 properties (enough for most small agencies, but cap is visible)
- 30 photos/property (OK but not great for luxury)
- 1,000 contacts (fills up in 6-12 months)
- No AI features (photos look amateur)
- No portal sync (manual posting to Immobiliare.it is painful)

**Upgrade trigger**: "My photos look bad compared to competitors, need AI → upgrade to Professional"

### Professional (€19.90/user/month)

**Purpose**: Match Gestim Professional, win medium agencies

**Features**: Unlimited properties, portal sync, basic AI

**Limits designed to frustrate**:
- AI enhancement: only 20/month (enough for 2 properties)
- No virtual staging (competitors have staged photos, we don't)
- SMS: only 100/month (not enough for active follow-ups)
- No WhatsApp (everyone in Italy uses WhatsApp)

**Upgrade trigger**: "I need virtual staging for empty properties → upgrade to Business"

### Business (€29.90/user/month) ⭐ TARGET TIER

**Purpose**: Win large agencies with unique features

**Features**:
- AI enhancement: 200/month (enough for 20 properties)
- Virtual staging: 10/month (taste of magic)
- WhatsApp integration
- Advanced automation
- API access

**Limits designed to frustrate**:
- Virtual staging: only 10/month (luxury agency needs 50+)
- No white label (franchises need this)
- No custom AI models (large agencies want custom)

**Upgrade trigger**: "We're a luxury agency, need 50 virtual stagings/month → upgrade to Enterprise"

### Enterprise (€49.90/user/month)

**Purpose**: Premium tier for luxury/franchise agencies

**Features**: Everything unlimited + white label + dedicated support

**No limits**: This is the "no compromises" tier

**Target**:
- Luxury agencies (Sotheby's, Christie's affiliates)
- Franchises (RE/MAX, Century 21)
- Large agencies (30+ agents)

You have 5 empty properties that have been listed for 60+ days.

Solution: Virtual staging (add furniture with AI).

Upgrade to Business (€29.90/user/month):
✅ Virtual staging (10/month) - industry standard is €50/photo, you get it included
✅ 200 AI enhancements/month (10x more)

**Email**:
```
Hi [Name],

Congrats on 30 agents and €5M in sales! 🚀

✅ 100 virtual stagings/month (10x more)
✅ White label (your brand, not ours)
✅ Custom AI models (trained on your style)
✅ Dedicated account manager
✅ API access (integrate with your tools)

Cost: +€20/user/month (€600/month for 30 agents)

## 9. Implementation: Soft Limits & Upgrade Prompts

### Soft Limits (Warn Before Block)

**Don't hard-block immediately** (bad UX), give warnings:

**Example: AI Enhancement Limit**

**19/20 used**:
```
⚠️ You've used 19 of 20 AI enhancements this month.

Want unlimited? Upgrade to Enterprise (€49.90/user/month)
Or add more: €0.50/enhancement pay-as-you-go

[Upgrade] [Buy more] [Remind me later]
```

**20/20 used**:
```
🚫 You've reached your AI enhancement limit (20/month).

Options:
1. Upgrade to Business (200/month) - Best value: €0.15/enhancement
2. Upgrade to Enterprise (unlimited) - €0/enhancement
3. Pay-as-you-go (€0.50/enhancement) - This month only

[Upgrade to Business] [Upgrade to Enterprise] [Pay €0.50/enhancement]

Your next limit resets in 12 days.
```

**Psychology**: Show the math, make upgrade obvious choice.

### In-App Upgrade Prompts

**Strategic placement**:

1. **When trying restricted feature**:
   - User clicks "Virtual Staging" on Professional plan
   - Modal: "Virtual staging is available on Business plan (€29.90/user). [See examples] [Upgrade now] [Remind me later]"

2. **After experiencing value**:
   - User enhances 5 photos with AI (loves it)
   - Banner: "You've enhanced 5 photos! 🎉 Upgrade to Business for 10x more (200/month). [Upgrade]"

3. **When hitting limits**:
   - User uploads 31st photo on Free plan (limit 30)
   - Modal: "Looks like you need more space! Upgrade to Starter (€9.90/user) for 100 properties. [Upgrade]"

4. **Comparative value**:
   - User on Professional, viewing Business features
   - Card: "Virtual staging (Business plan): €29.90/month = €1/property. Hiring a stager: €50/property. Save €49/property. [Upgrade]"
