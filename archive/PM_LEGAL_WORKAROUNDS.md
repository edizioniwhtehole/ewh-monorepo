## ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK Features (Workarounds Implemented)

### Workflow Automation

#### RISKY Approach (Salesforce Patent) ❌
**Patent**: US 9,558,265 (Salesforce, 2017-2037)
**Claims**: Drag-and-drop workflow nodes with if/else logic
**Risk**: 🔥 **HIGH** (recent patent, broad claims, Salesforce actively enforces)

#### ✅ SAFE Workaround #1: n8n/Zapier Integration (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation**:
```markdown
**Phase 1 - External Integration** (100% safe):
- PM system sends webhook events (task_created, task_completed, etc.)
- User builds workflows in n8n/Zapier UI (NOT in PM system)
- n8n/Zapier calls PM API to create tasks, update status, etc.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ 100% legal (no visual builder in PM system)
- ✅ Powerful (n8n/Zapier have 5000+ integrations)
- ✅ No development cost (use existing tools)
- ✅ Users already familiar with n8n/Zapier

**Drawbacks**:
- ⚠️ Extra step (user needs n8n/Zapier account)
- ⚠️ Not embedded in PM UI
```

**Code example**:
```typescript
// svc-pm/src/webhooks/outbound.service.ts

export class OutboundWebhookService {
  async sendTaskCreatedEvent(task: Task) {
    const webhookUrls = await this.getActiveWebhooks('task_created');

    for (const url of webhookUrls) {
      await fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          event: 'task_created',
          task_id: task.id,
          task_title: task.title,
          assigned_to: task.assigned_to,
          due_date: task.due_date,
          project_id: task.project_id
        })
      });
    }
  }
}
```

**User experience**:
1. User connects n8n to PM system (API key)
2. User creates workflow in n8n: "When task completed → Send Slack message"
3. PM system sends webhook to n8n when task completed
4. n8n executes workflow (send Slack message)

---

#### ✅ SAFE Workaround #2: Table-Based Rules (ALTERNATIVE)

**Implementation**:
```markdown
**Phase 1 - Simple Rules** (100% safe):
- Dropdown selectors (no drag-and-drop)
- IF-THEN logic (no visual editor)
- Rule templates library

**UI Design** (NOT visual):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Create Automation Rule                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ IF:                                          │
│   [Task Status ▼] [Changes to ▼] [Completed ▼] │
│                                              │
│ THEN:                                        │
│   [Send Email ▼] to [Task Creator ▼]        │
│                                              │
│ [+ Add Condition] [+ Add Action]             │
│                                              │
│ [Save Rule] [Test Rule]                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Benefits**:
- ✅ 100% legal (no visual builder)
- ✅ Embedded in PM UI (better UX)
- ✅ Easy for non-technical users

**Drawbacks**:
- ⚠️ Less powerful than n8n (no complex logic)
- ⚠️ Need to build rule engine
```

**Database schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pm.automation_rules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,

  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,

  -- Trigger (IF part)
  trigger_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'task_status_changed', 'due_date_approaching'
  trigger_conditions JSONB, -- { field: 'status', operator: 'equals', value: 'completed' }

  -- Actions (THEN part)
  actions JSONB, -- [{ type: 'send_email', params: { to: 'task_creator', template: 'task_completed' } }]

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Code example**:
```typescript
// svc-pm/src/automation/rule-engine.service.ts

export class RuleEngineService {
  async executeRules(event: { type: string; data: any }) {
    const rules = await this.getActiveRules(event.type);

    for (const rule of rules) {
      if (this.evaluateConditions(rule.trigger_conditions, event.data)) {
        await this.executeActions(rule.actions, event.data);
      }
    }
  }

  private evaluateConditions(conditions: any, data: any): boolean {
    // Simple condition evaluation
    const { field, operator, value } = conditions;

    switch (operator) {
      case 'equals':
        return data[field] === value;
      case 'not_equals':
        return data[field] !== value;
      case 'contains':
        return data[field]?.includes(value);
      default:
        return false;
    }
  }

  private async executeActions(actions: any[], data: any) {
    for (const action of actions) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'send_email':
          await this.emailService.send({
            to: this.resolveRecipient(action.params.to, data),
            template: action.params.template,
            data
          });
          break;
        case 'create_task':
          await this.tasksService.create({
            title: action.params.title,
            project_id: data.project_id
          });
          break;
        // ... more actions
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### ❌ RISKY Approach: Visual Builder (AVOID in Phase 1)

**Only implement if**:
1. Legal review ($10k) confirms safety
2. Willing to risk $50k-200k defense cost if sued
3. Have documented prior art (Node-RED 2013, Yahoo Pipes 2007)

**Recommendation**: ❌ **DON'T DO IT** - Use workaround #1 or #2 instead
