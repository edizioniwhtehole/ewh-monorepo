# DAM Modern UI Redesign - October 15, 2025

## Summary

## Design Principles

### Consistency with EWH Apps
The new design follows the established pattern used across all EWH applications:

- **Lightbox Modal**: Full-screen preview with detailed metadata
- **AI Features Placeholder**: Prominent "AI Tools" button ready for future integration
- **Advanced Filters**: Expandable filter panel with AI status filtering
- **Multi-select**: Shift+click for bulk operations
- **Hover Effects**: Modern card animations and actions on hover
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support matching the app ecosystem
